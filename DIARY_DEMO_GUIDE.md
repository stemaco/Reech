### **Hardcoded Previous Entries:**
- **4 sample diary entries** from previous days

- **Varied topics**: work, family, hobbies, challenges
- **Realistic content** that shows the AI's writing style

## ðŸš€ **How the Smart Updating Works:**

### **First Time (No Diary Exists):**
1. **Chat with Reech**: "I had a great day at work today"
2. **Click "Create Today's Diary"**
3. **AI creates**: A new diary entry based on your conversation

### **Subsequent Times (Diary Exists):**
1. **Chat more**: "I also went for a walk in the evening"
2. **Click "Update Today's Diary"**
3. **AI updates**: The existing diary by naturally incorporating new conversations

### **Example Update Process:**
```
Original Diary: "Today was a really productive day! I woke up early and went for a morning run..."

New Conversation: "I also went for a walk in the evening and saw a beautiful sunset"

Updated Diary: "Today was a really productive day! I woke up early and went for a morning run, which set a great tone for the rest of the day. Work was busy but manageable, and I managed to complete three important projects. In the evening, I went for a peaceful walk and was treated to a beautiful sunset that reminded me to appreciate the simple moments in life..."
```
