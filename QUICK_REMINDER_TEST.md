# ⚡ Quick Reminder Test

## Your Scenario: "remind me a meeting at 18:33" (current time: 18:31)

**Answer: YES, it will remind you!** ✅

## How it works:

### **Short Interval Logic (< 2 minutes):**
- If reminder is less than 2 minutes away
- It skips the 1-hour and 15-minute warnings
- Sends only 1 reminder at the scheduled time
- Uses a special "quick reminder" message

### **Your Example:**
- **Current time:** 18:31
- **Reminder time:** 18:33 (2 minutes away)
- **What happens:**
  1. System detects it's less than 2 minutes away
  2. Skips 1-hour and 15-minute reminders
  3. Schedules 1 reminder for 18:33
  4. At 18:33, you get: "Quick reminder! 'a meeting' at 6:33 PM - Get ready! ⚡"

## Test Scenarios:

### **Very Short (30 seconds):**
- "remind me to check email in 30 seconds"
- Gets: "Quick reminder! 'check email' at [time] - Get ready! ⚡"

### **Short (2 minutes):**
- "remind me a meeting at 18:33" (current: 18:31)
- Gets: "Quick reminder! 'a meeting' at 6:33 PM - Get ready! ⚡"

### **Medium (10 minutes):**
- "remind me to call mom in 10 minutes"
- Gets: 2 reminders:
  - At 5 minutes: "Reminder in 15 minutes! 'call mom' at [time] 🚀"
  - At scheduled time: "Time for your reminder! 'call mom' - Hope you're ready! ⏰"

### **Long (2 hours):**
- "remind me to submit report at 8pm" (current: 6pm)
- Gets: 3 reminders:
  - At 7pm: "Hey! Your reminder is in 1 hour at 8:00 PM. Time to get ready!"
  - At 7:45pm: "Reminder in 15 minutes! 'submit report' at 8:00 PM 🚀"
  - At 8pm: "Time for your reminder! 'submit report' - Hope you're ready! ⏰"

## Test it yourself:
1. Set your system time to 18:31
2. Type: "remind me a meeting at 18:33"
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. You should see the quick reminder message!

The system is smart enough to handle any time interval! 🎯
