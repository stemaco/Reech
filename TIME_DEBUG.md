# üïê Time Display Debug

## Issue: Seeing `[current time]` instead of real time

This suggests there's a placeholder that's not being replaced with the actual time.

## Quick Fix:

### 1. **Check Browser Console**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Look for the time formatting logs
- You should see: `Formatting time: 6:41 PM from date: [Date object]`

### 2. **Hard Refresh**
- Press `Ctrl + F5` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
- This clears the cache and reloads the app

### 3. **Check if it's a Mockup**
- The image you showed might be from a design mockup
- Make sure you're looking at the actual running app at `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. **Test Time Display**
- Send a message: "What time is it?"
- The bot should respond with the current time
- Check the timestamp below each message

## Expected Behavior:
- **Welcome message timestamp**: Should show current time (e.g., "6:41 PM")
- **All message timestamps**: Should show when they were sent
- **No placeholders**: Should never see `[current time]` in the actual app

## If Still Seeing Placeholders:
1. **Clear browser cache completely**
2. **Restart the dev server**: `npm run dev`
3. **Check if you're looking at the right URL**
4. **Look at browser console for errors**

The time formatting code is correct, so this is likely a caching or display issue rather than a code problem.
